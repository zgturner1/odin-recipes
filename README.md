# odin-recipes
This project (odin-recpies) is going to be the first major HTML project I have done. I am currently
at the end of the 'HTML Basics' section of the 'Foundations' course in the Odin Project as of April
15, 2022.

This project is going to be a basic website that will describe how to make some dishes. As of April 15,
2022, it will not use any CSS or JavaScript. By the end of this project, I should have a better understanding
of basic HTML syntax and website structure, as well as file management.

EDIT: 4/18/2022
Added CSS to make the site look nicer and easier to interact with.
